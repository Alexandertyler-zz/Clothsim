Cloth Simulation - Kristin Goedicke cs184-dg, Lizzie Ye cs184-es, Alex Tyler cs184-az

README

1. Compile the program with "make"
2. Use "./as4" to run the program
3. Program defaults to stripe pattern cloth, 3 spheres, with a horizontal cloth drop, and user interaction enabled
4. Program options may be changed at the top of clothsim.cpp -- options include triangle pattern or stripe pattern cloth, 0-3 spheres, fixed back or side corner cloth points, and user interaction.

User interaction:
's' - starts the simulation, and thereafter when pressed - pauses and resumes the simulation
'w' - toggles between wireframe and filled
'b' and 'm' - moves sphere(s) left and right, respectively
'n' and 'j' - moves sphere(s) down and up, respectively
arrow keys - rotates the scene
